## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Closed-lid operation on battery** via pmset's `disablesleep` flag, scoped to
  battery power so behaviour on AC is unchanged.
- **Display-aware watcher** running as a `launchd` system daemon. The override is
  enabled only while an external display is attached, so a lid closed with no
  monitor still sleeps normally.
- **External display detection** through IOKit `SinkDeviceOUI` registry nodes,
  which works without a GUI session and costs ~23 ms per poll.
- **Sub-second mode switching.** The watcher re-reads the mode file every
  second and re-probes displays every five, so switching mode and immediately
  closing the lid no longer races a stale flag.
- **Three modes** — `auto` (display-aware), `on` (always awake), `off` (stock
  behaviour) — switchable without sudo via `~/.config/clamshell/mode`.
- **Menu bar app** (Swift/AppKit, `LSUIElement`) showing live state and offering
  one-click mode switching.
- **Custom closed-lid icon**, drawn with `NSBezierPath` because SF Symbols has no
  shut-lid glyph. Solid means the lid can be closed without sleeping; outlined
  means it will sleep; a warning triangle means the watcher has stopped.
- **Open at Login** toggle using `SMAppService` on macOS 13+, falling back to a
  LaunchAgent when registration is refused for a locally built app.
- **`clamshell json`** for machine-readable status.
- **Behavioural test suite** stubbing the display probe on `PATH`, covering the
  full mode truth table plus fail-safe paths.
- **Installer and uninstaller** that resolve the invoking user, generate the
  LaunchDaemon from a template, and self-verify the result.
